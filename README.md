JsDoc NG
========

While this [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) doesn't expose *all* the functionalities
of [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/), it's __good enough__ (at least for me) for normal usage.

The `windowTitle` option for the template allows to specify the window title.

This template has been forked out of my original
[Grunt Plugin](https://github.com/usrz/javascript-grunt-jsdoc-ng)
and is licensed as MIT.
